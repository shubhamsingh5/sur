Capstone design project for ECE454 Mobile Computing Laboratory class at UW-Madison.

The app seeks to simplify pianist's lives by removing the need to manually flip pages of sheet music during a performance. The app allows pianists to select the piece of music they will play and hit start. The app will then recognize each note being played by computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in real time and once the last note on a page is played, the next page will be displayed automatically.
